1 Why does that pigtailed green eyed girl in FNaF 4 look like Baby? (Baby came second, but still) 2 Why would the plush Fredbear say “we are still your friends, do you still believe that” unless they had done something to him? This is what makes me hesitant when people say that in the gameplay of FNaF 4, you’re playing as Michael. They haunted BV at night for all those nights, maybe that is what plushie Fredbear was talking about; he and the others were haunting BV in FNaF 4, making the gamepla. Hi, I want to know if there is a fix for fnaf 4 having to load each area of the room, it makes the game unplayable on later nights. I can remember from Dawko’s livestream a few weeks ago that he said it was possible for there to be more than one kid under these experiments conducted by Afton (or whoever is doing it). How does that make sense? How does the map explain FNaF 4 in general? (I’m still confused even though I heard his explanation.). Not too long ago on the fnaf discord, we were discussing how exactly a person is supposed to ascend/descend in between CBEAR and the fnaf 4 locations connected to it. (https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/337299937144340490/568213533972758539/image0.png) I suggested that it was probably just by elevators or a staircase even But I rewatched an SL playthorugh today, and I just noticed that the breaker room map says elevator s (https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/337299937144340490. Ya know how in fnaf 4 the brother stole the foxy head? That would make the plushie large enough to fit a teenager. Also, during the nights, the plush has a head which would make the night plushies and minigame plushies different. Unless, they are both sizes in the cannon. Remember in the twisted ones it had the mind thingys which made things look different? What if the nights took place from the older brother's perspective because he feels guilty about traumatizing and killing his brother 1. Disc Theory The discs in the books are widely known as being a book-universe-only feature. But what if they aren’t? What if MatPat is correct and Funtime Freddy’s power module IS a hallucination disc? It’s possible that the Funtimes become the nightmares once their discs are activated. 2. Nightmare Theory This is the classic theory that I believe. It simply goes that we play as Michael, and he has nightmares from his brother’s point of view about all of this. Or maybe the short. Scott said it was all the pieces put together. The Candy Cadet stories talk about 5 thing becoming one. I think he talk about Michael Afton becoming one with the 4 animatronics. And this is all the pieces together. So I think there is a blueprint of Michael Afton's body in this box. It would explain how Ennard can get in and just how Michael 
If Mikevictim really is true, then it must have been planned since FNAF 4. Meaning using the lore and evidence given to us in FNAF 1-4, you should be able to prove it. If not, however, Mikevictim is deconfirmed  I have yet to see a single Mikevictim theorist answer/prove this, and if I find someone who does, then that's an entirely different story. Log 1: So far, there are zero theories in the comment section that have proven Mikevictim using the prerequisites provided above.
