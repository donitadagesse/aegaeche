                            <p>Hello fellow homelabbers, I am quite curious and confused about this topic. Some say VMs for the win, others say containers (especially Docker) are the way to do stuff. Long story short about me: I have just one node which is PITA to begin with. It’s my NAS, compute, test machine and so on. My situation somehow should show why I have such doubts/questions. Please note that I am planning to get SFF (I might go Optiplex route) machines and build whitebox NAS/storage server and connect everythin. hi all, amp#x200B; i'm experiencing an issue as to where Sonarr struggles with post processing and is no longer automatically importing tv shows to its final destination on my file server. amp#x200B; Error: Import failed, path does not exist or is not accessible by Sonarr: \\192.168.1.30\downloads\completed\series\series\American.Dad.S15E05.720p.WEBRip.x264-TBS amp#x200B; Now from my Sonarr vm, i do have access to the above path. i have tried locally mapping my Ultraseedbo. Hi! I currently own a seedbox which only has 1tb. I have a lot more space locally and would like to offer some long term seeding but I'm looking for the safest way to do it. I think this would be through an SSH tunnel / VPN / Proxy. My seedbox provider has OpenVPN on it but I don't know enough to set it up. amp#x200B; Locally I'm running an ESXi system with VMs set up for various local tasks (Plex, FreeNAS, etc). Can I set up a VM with a torrent client (which is the best?) I'm trying to seed using Deluge. I can download torrents fine, but once it switches to seeding nothing ever happens. I'm using a VPN, uPnP is off. I have the port manually set. If I go to canyouseeme and test my VPN ip and the port it doesn't see it as open. I can be actively downloading a torrent and Deluge will also say there's an issue when testing the port. The only thing that I can think of is that maybe it has something to do with running inside an ESXi host's VM, so the host's virtual. 
Basically, I just got a used Dell server. It currently has a 10c/20t processor and 96 GB ram. I have three 10TB WD drives from the EasyStore deals and a left over 500GB Samsung SSD. My goal is to have a NAS, Docker support (for Plex, Torrent, Sonarr, Radarr, PiHole, custom webserver, etc. -- this can also be done though a VM like Rancher with Portainer) and also VM support although I will not run any VMs at the moment, but I do want the option. I was originally thinking of just installing FreeN. I've just created a Debian server on ESXi to download files and put them on my NAS, and I'm running the whole thing through a PrivateInternetAccess VPN. When I'm not downloading anything, I can run a speedtest and get 150Mbps. As soon as I start a torrent through transmission, that drops to about 10Mbps - even though the bandwidth used by the torrent is only like 500kbps. The more torrents I run at once the worse it gets. What's going This build was inspired by the Anniversary Build - pretty cookie cutter. I was looking to offload some tasks from my desktop so I wanted to wet my feet with building something that could handle the following tasks: Some sort of NAS capability. Went with UnRAID for simplicity. I just wanted something simple that works. I'm far from an advanced user. Just need some simple file shares, some sort of AFP ability to do Time Machine backups for the MBP's in the house. Server Specs - CPU: i7 2600 16GB RAM 320GB HDD 4TB HDD 1GB Network Adapter My server is running Windows 10 as the host (wish I had gone with a hypervisor but too much stuff on it to change now), with Virtual Box running my VMs. I have an Ubuntu 18.04 VM running a Minecraft server and a SFTP server, and then a Windows 10 VM running my torrent client, VPN, and automated processes related to that. On my host I am running Plex. I am experiencing any significant downgrade in performance because. Hey Guys, This is a bit of a weird one. Currently have an ESXi Host, and use my Server 2016 VM to Resillo Sync with my UltraSeedbox onto my NAS. This is currently working okay, but the speed between them is not that great, and varies all over the place. I have a subscription to TorGuard, and was hoping I could set up a separate VM that uses a VPN to torrent, but also is able to push the completed files to my NAS? I've done some searching through here and just general googling, and can't i currently have a old PC Tower running esxi 6.5. Current Specs: 2 CPUs x Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2100 CPU @ 3.10GHz RAM: 6 GB amp#x200B; I mostly run one main VM on there, a Windows 10 image hosting: Ubiquiti Wi-Fi controller (service) Sonarr (service) Radarr (service) uTorrent (applicationn) Jackett (service) amp#x200B; pumps stuff to a NAS. amp#x200B; Now bear in mind, the Windows 10 VM runs like shit, its sluggish, but i only "manually" use it, when a service So i'm planning a bunch of upgrades in the next few months, starting with my desktop, then my network, and finally learning some server stuff. I figure a single esxi machine is the best way to start as I play with vm's, learn pfsense, etc. Right now I have my desktop pc, which is also my plex host, my main storage, I'm running an ubuntu guest in virtual box (working my way through The Odin Project), (https://www.theodinproject.com)everything. I definitely would like to build a machine to offlo. For my homelab, I'm putting together two R610 esxi 6.7 hosts; and one R515 running FreeNAS 11.2 with 8x 3TB SAS disks. There will be a lot of things going on the hosts, but the biggest resource hogs will be Plex and torrents. I have a symmetrical gig internet connection, run torrents 24x7, and several friends sharing my Plex, just to give you an idea of how much utilization there can be at times. amp#x200B; The R515 has 64GB RAM already. I've got 2x16GB modules on hand, but it won't accept. 
Hey guys, I am no expert here, just looking for your thoughts on my setup and curious how your systems are configured. I have a single e5-2670v2 server with 32gb of ram. 15k passmark. I THINK I'm going to run Ubuntu OS with docker. (still debating if I should use esxi baremetal with VMs but seems like a waste of resources) I want to have: -PMS -Sonarr/Radarr/Ombi/Tautulli with PFsense reverse proxy so users can have outside access -PIA VPN download client/TorrentBox Hi homelab friends. I have recently gotten much more into this hobby and the next thing I wanted to set up was some sort of monitoring system. I have seen the wiki list, but there are so many and I am not sure of the pros and cons of each. I was hoping I could list my current hardware and see if anyone had any insights for what may be the best to use for me. I have: My personal gaming rig Synology 918+ running Plex A beefy Ubuntu box running nonstop gpu intensive machine learning stuff. Yo, So for the last 10 years or so I've have moved away from custom built "file servers" to let dedicated NAS boxes to all the lifting. I've settled for QNAP and I'm on my 6th or so QNAP NAS box and currently have TWO. One TS 831-X (2x10Gig SFP+ ports, 6x6TB SATA drives) - 21TB of volumes One TS 853-Pro (4x1G, 8x3TB SATA drives) - 19TB of volumes The first NAS is mainly used as a backup destination, for Veeam backups from VMware and for rsync of important data from my 853-Pro. Hello everyone! I started on /r/DataHoarder and found myself over here, given that I want to get into proper server hardware. You all seem like a smart group, and hopefully, you're able to guide me in the right direction in terms of software. I've read through all the wiki pages on here but I still need some help. Just for reference, I'm going to be buying a Dell R710 (6x3.5" bays) with 2x L5640's, 32gb RAM, H700 controller, and an iDrac 6 module. I plan to fill it up with 6 4tb hard drives. Although my old (built in 2011) "server" configuration has done its share over the years, I'm looking to revamp my setup going forward. I've done some research but I still have a few questions before I attempt this budgetish rebuild (budget hopefully no more than 0 - 700 CAD, although cheaper is always better). My IT experience is mostly in networking, but I have dabbled with ESXi, Apache, and Windows AD at work. The main uses for this build would be: Media/file storage/sharing. 
Hey guys, I'm in the process of building up a list of parts for my first home server build. I currently have an Ubuntu desktop, a Xubuntu laptop and a Windows laptop (used irregularly). My ADSL master socket is in the living room, and my router-modem has a Pi plugged in running pivpn (have also tinkered with PiHole). I'd like to have something quiet/low power and the best place would be in the television unit so a slim/HTPC form factor. As my desktop is mini-ITX I like small builds I originally put this in a bigger thread but did not get any replies to it so posting it on own. Currently I run plex on a i7 3770k, 16gb, and a gtx1050 on win10pro with vbox running another win10pro for vpn/torrent. Everything runs good. I also have a R710 server, x5650 x2, 72gb. Will be bare metal with esxi. I was wondering if I moved plex to the r710 would I get better performance. As of right now i am no where near maxing out the 3770k but i am also hardware transcoding on the 1050. I'm wanting to setup a home storage system mainly for file access. I have a spare box to setup as a dedicated NAS, i also have a HP ProLiant DL360 G7 running esxi. the esxi is running the following: - Home Automation - PFSense - Linux Server (random stuff, game servers, torrent host) I would like to find out what my best option is for storing media. I want it to be available 24/7 and have the option to add / replace drives as needed for expansion or replacement of bad drives without having. 
I have recently acquired two servers and a switch gratis. 2x Dell PE R610; one with 2x E5645 CPUs amp 96 GB RAM (6x16GB); the other with 2x E5649 CPUs amp 192 GB RAM (12x16GB). Each has a PERC H700 1GB controller with 6x 2.5" SAS bays, and 8 gigabit NIC ports (half onboard). For drives, I have available 4x 50GB SSD, 4x 300GB SAS, 2x 600GB SAS, and 2x 4TB SATA. amp#x200B; For networking, I have a Cisco 3750G-48PS, and a Pace 5268AC which was provided with my ATampT Fiber Dears, amp#x200B; After checking all my options for a seedbox with plex, i found out that Hetzner dedicated servers were my best options. I bought one server from them and fully set it up with a firewall, nating, and some labs virtual machines for myself. amp#x200B; Now the main reason i bought the server for was for a seedbox + plex setup. So, I installed Ubuntu, and run quickbox, which setup rTorrent perfectly and it is working great. Now, when I try to use autodl-irsii, it works So I am trying to set up a secure and robust way to seed through my seedbox's IP, over an encrypted connection, to obfuscate my IP and hide my traffic from snooping eyes. I have a freenas box with a bunch of things on it, and I want to be able to seed from this box without my ISP knowing, or really anyone in my country knowing for that matter. I have freenas running under ESXi, so I can easily spin up an Ubuntu VM next to it, SMB into my /tank and seed away with likely rtorrent. Hello, I have been looking at several benchmark results, and articles about how FreeNAS is not the best performance wise (maybe in relation to NFS/SMB performance) but I have not come across any specific details. I personally would like to use an interface that has a Simple Web UI (ala FreeNAS) but with shell access and more freedom(ala Ubuntu). I am much more used to Ubuntu compared to BSD Hardware Setup: CPU: 1700 RAM: 32GB ECC (soon to be 64) Motherboard: X470 Master SLI/ac I recently did a search on this sub and didn't find many posts about people using FreeBSD in their labs. I recently started making YouTube tutorials and received a pretty good response at /r/FreeBSD on my few FreeBSD videos. I am a big fan of this subreddit and want to see more people using FreeBSD. The organization I work for runs FreeBSD on 99% of the infrastructure from the routers down to the file servers. Here are some of my ideas for videos and projects. The Homelab classics but on FreeB.
